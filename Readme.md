# pristat static site generator

---

Basically, I wanted a dead simple static site generator that played well with Prismic and didn't like the plugins for other static site generators, and found it too tedious to tie into their systems.

For many, this might not make sense, but if you just want a quick and simple way to write templates for your prismic content and generate a static site, this is for you.
